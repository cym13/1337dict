Description
===========

This is a 1337-speak dictionnary generator. It combines words and generates
all 1337-speak variations of those combinations.

For example:

::

    $ 1337dict a b
    a
    A
    4
    @
    b
    B
    ab
    aB
    Ab
    AB
    4b
    4B
    @b
    @B

Here the words were very small in order to keep the output small, you can of
course use real words.

It is designed to be very efficient, you have no reason to worry about your
memory usage. You can also speed it up by setting length boundaries:
combinations that do not fit that boundary will never get generated.

By default 1337dict does not permute its elements, it keeps them in order.
This explains why in the previous example *ba* is never generated. In order
to enable the permutations use the --permute flag.
